<hr>

<p><strong>Version 9.940  09/06/15</strong><br/>
The Min/Max command used for optimization in the Professional version provides the option to display a Sensitivity table in the Solution window that shows how the optimum depends on each independent variable.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.921  08/12/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic property information for orthoHydrogen have been implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.919  08/10/15</strong><br/>
A common cause of problems with EES is a corrupted preferences file.  Clicking the Reset button in the Preferences dialog will restore to the preferences to their as-shipped values.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.916  08/06/15</strong><br/>
The $SaveVarInfo directive can be used in the Professional version to save variable information (e.g, guess values, limits, units, and format) to a .VAR file.  This information can be retrieved with a $Include directive, or with the Load buttons in the Variable Information dialog and the Diagram window.  This directive provides an automatic way to save the variable information in a Distributable program.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.915  08/03/15</strong><br/>
Lookup table files can be saved or read from Excel .XLSX files using the Save Table or Open Lookup Table menu commands.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.911  07/26/15</strong><br/>
The <a href="http://fchart.com/ees/64-bit.php">64-bit version</a> has been released.  It requires a 64-bit license file and is only applicable for the Professional version.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.910  07/21/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic property data for R1243zf have been added to the property database. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.905  07/11/15</strong><br/>
In the Professional version, the choices made for the calculated and measured variables and their associated relative or absolute uncertainties can be saved by clicking the Save Uncertainty Information button in the Uncertainty Propagation or Uncertainty Propagation Table dialog.  These choices can later be restored by clicking the Open Uncertainty Information button in these dialogs.  Saving the uncertainty information allows one EES file to solve several different uncertainty problems without having to reenter the uncertainty settings.  The Save Uncertainty Information saves a text file having an .UNC file name extension.  
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.886  06/01/15</strong><br/>
A selected range of rows and columns can be saved with the $SAVETABLE directive using the /R and /C options.  For example, /R5..10 will save only rows 5 through 10. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.885  05/28/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport data for HydrogenChloride (HCl)have been added to the property database. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.882  05/26/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport data for diethylether (also called ethyl ether  and ethyl oxide) have been added to the property database. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.880  05/17/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport data for R40 (also called chloromethane and methyl chloride) have been added to the property database. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.869  04/28/15</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Version 9.852  03/23/15</strong><br/>
If the Solve command is issued when the number of equations is not equal to the number of variables, EES will issue an appropriate error message and offer to display Debug information.  When the number of variables is greater than the number of equations, the Debug information provides a list of variables that are likely to be involved in the missing equation(s).  The diagnostic ability to identify these variables has been improved.  Further, EES provides a Solve button within the Debug window that will allow solving equations up to the point where EES has detected the missing equation(s) should appear.  The partial solution can be viewed in the Solutions window.  Variables whose values could not be determined are shown in gray font.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.846  03/14/15</strong><br/>
The LowerHeatingValue and HigherHeatingValue functions can be used for NASA gases that contain only elements O, C, and H. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.838  03/04/15</strong><br/>
The behavior of the plot crosshairs tool has changed.  The crosshairs can now also be used to identify the location of a plotted point in a table.  Position the crosshairs over a plotted symbol and press the right mouse button.  The status bar will show the coordinates of the point, the table that the data originated in and the row in that table. To cancel the crosshairs, move the mouse  so that the crosshairs is no longer in the plot rectangle.  The status bar and the crosshairs will then disappear. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.833  02/25/15</strong><br/>
Clicking the left mouse button on the text highlight button (Professional version) below the menu bar will toggle the highlighting between the currently selected highlighting color and no highlighting.  Right-clicking the button will bring up a dialog in which the highlighting color can be selected. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.831  02/21/15</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport data for DeuteriumOxide (Heavy Water) have been added to the property database. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.828  02/16/15</strong><br/>
This version marks the first release of the Component Library for the Professional version.  The Component Library provides high-level EES components for use in analysis and design of energy systems.  Information relating to the Component Library is available <a href="http://fchart.com/ees/component%20library/hs1.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p>The code that allows equations from the Formatted Equations Window to be copied as MATHTYPE objects has been revised to work with the latest version of MATHTYPE.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.826  02/15/15</strong><br/>
EES library files (identified with a .LIB file name extension) can be placed in the USERLIB directory and they will be automatically loaded at startup.  In some cases, a library file may need to call a routine (function, procedure, subprogram) in another library file.  To ensure that a routine is not called before the library it exists in is loaded, a $INCLUDE directive can be placed at the top of the library file followed by the complete path name of the library file.  $USERLIB is accepted as the USERLIB directory in the EES folder, so the EES folder can be placed anywhere. The following example shows how the internal flow library can be loaded.
<br>
$INCLUDE $USERLIB\Heat Transfer\Convection\Internal_flow.lib </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.821  02/05/15</strong><br/>
Clicking the Ex: in the Function Information dialog will select all of the text in the Example edit control.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.818  02/03/15</strong><br/>
EES automatically fills the minimum, maximum, and interval fields in the plot setup dialog with values appropriate to the variables that are to be plotted.  However, up to this version, EES used all of the data in a selected column of table, rather than the range of rows specified in the dialog to select the plot scale values.  Now, EES will only use the data within the specified row range.   The minimum and maximum scale values will change as you change the row range.  EES will not change the minimum or maximum values if you have edited the values.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.809  01/17/15</strong><br/>
Functions, Procedures, and Subprograms can each have separate unit setting by placing a $UnitSystem directive within the program unit in the Equations window.  If no specification is provided, the unit settings for Functions, Procedures, and Subprograms are the same as those for the calling program.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.803  01/07/15</strong><br/>
The menu bar now provides a Check Units button.  Clicking this button will check unit consistency without solving the equations.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.795  12/16/14</strong><br/>
The $RunMacroAfter directive allows macros to be embedded within the Equations window.  The macro is run after the calculations are completed.  Variables that are defined with the macro commands are displayed in the Macro Variables tab of the Solution window.  These features are available in the Professional version.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.793  12/13/14</strong><br/>
The PropPlot macro command will accept previously defined variables as well as numerical constants to set the values for  lines of constant properties.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.789  12/11/14</strong><br/>
The $IF and $IFNOT directives will accept a condition that can be a simple expression, e.g., T$='K' or a boolean expression using the OR and AND operators.  Parentheses can be added to control the boolean order of evaluation, e.g., $IF (T$='T') and ((P$='kPa) or (P$='bar'))</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.785  12/07/14</strong><br/>
Improved thermodynamic property data have been implemented for cyclohexane using the equation of state from Zhou, Y, Liu, J, Penoncello, S., and Lemmon, E., J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 43, No. 4, 2014.

<p><strong>Version 9.781  11/20/14</strong><br/>
HideWindow ErrorMessages in a Macro file will prevent error messages from displaying when a macro is started with the Play button in the Macro window.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.772  11/06/14</strong><br/>
The StdDev(x[1..10]) calculates the standard deviation of a set of values.  The format is the same as for the Sum and Average functions.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.767  10/30/14</strong><br/>
  The Uncertainty and UncertaintyTable macro commands can specify an EES variable to be the absolute or relative uncertainty of a measured uncertainty value.  In the UncertaintyTable macro command, the value of the variable specified to be the uncertainty can change in each row of the Parametric table.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.766  10/29/14</strong><br/>
The UncertaintyTable macro command has been added (Professional version).  In addition, the SolveTable, MinimizeTable, MaximizeTable and UncertaintyTable macro commands accept
optional flags /U, /S, and /R.  /U indicates that the guess values will be updated after the calculations for each row in the Parametric table are completed.  /S indicates that 
the calculations will stop if there is an error.  Otherwise EES will continue with calculations for the following row in the Parametric table.  /R indicates that the 
calculations will be done starting with the last row and ending with the first row. 
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.764  10/26/14</strong><br/>
Three new property functions have been added:  Enthalpy_formation, LowerHeatingValue, HigherHeatingValue.  The functions operate for fluids in the Ideal gas and NASA gas libraries 
and for the substances in the ..\USERLIB\INCOMPRESSIBLE\ORGANIC LIQUIDS folder.  See the online help for details.
</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.691  06/09/14</strong><br/>
Ammonia-water mixture properties can be accessed using EES property functions with fluid name NH3H2O.  The property functions require three independent properties which can be temperature (T), pressure (P), mass fraction (X), quality (Q), enthalpy (H), entropy (S), internal energy  (U) or volume (V).  Note that for NH3H2O, property designator X indicates mass fraction (not quality) and property designator Q is used for quality.  Function MassFraction returns the mass fraction of the mixture, given three other properties.  Thermodynamic properties are determined from the NH3H2O.DLP external procedure using the methods described in Ibrahim and Klein.  Property functions for liquid thermal conductivity, liquid viscosity, and surface tension have been implemented for NH3H2O.

However, you can force the Warnings dialog to not appear with the $HideWindow Warnings directive.  Note that the Warnings dialog can be manually made to appear by selecting Warnings from the Windows menu.  Similarly, the $ShowWindow Warnings will ensure that the Warnings dialog appears in front of all other windows if there are warnings to display.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.601  02/05/14</strong><br/>
Text and graphic items in the Plot and Diagram windows can be moved with the arrow keys.  When an arrow key is pressed the first time, the selected items will move 5 pixels.  If the key is held down, the selected items will move quickly.  Releasing and pressing the key again (within 3 seconds) will move the selected items by 1 pixel, allowing fine control.  If the arrow key is then held down for more than 3 seconds, the speed at which the selected items move in the designated direction will increase.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.600  02/03/14</strong><br/>

</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.554  11/20/13</strong><br/>
When the Uncertainty Propagation or Uncertainty Propagration Table has completed its calculations, the uncertainties of the calculated variable(s) are displayed in the Solution window.  Also displayed are the partial derivatives of the calculated variables with respect to each of the measured variables and the % of the uncertainty that can be attributed to each of the measured variables.  These uncertainty calculation results can be made available to EES variables with the Uncert.ParDif and Uncert.Percent functions. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.546  11/10/13</strong><br/>
EES can call external Functions and Procedures that are written in compiled languages such as FORTRAN, C, C++, and Pascal.  A description of how to write these external routines is provided in the
online help and in Mastering EES.  Starting in version 9.546, the external routines can return two strings containing the units of the inputs and the units of the outputs.  If these strings are 
provided, EES will check the units of the inputs and outputs to the externals routines, in the same manner as it checks units for EES Functions and Procedures.  Several of the external routines
provided with EES, e.g., NH3H2O, NASA, have been modified to include this capability. </p>
 
<p><strong>Version 9.543  11/06/13</strong><br/>
In the Professional version, the Residuals Window and the Computational Flow Window are both accessible from the Windows menu and the speed button bar located below the main menu.  
These two windows provide similar information, but in different formats.  Both windows are helpful in understanding how EES is solving the equations and in indentifying computational problems. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.539  11/02/13</strong><br/>
When used to copy data from any of the EES tables, the Copy command in the Edit menu will place the data on the Clipboard in two formats.  The first format copies the data just as it appears in the table.  
Significant figures beyond those
displayed in the table are lost.  When copied into another program, such as a word processor or spreadsheet, these data will appear exactly as they did in the EES table.  However, if the data are pasted into an EES table, the 
second format will be used in which 14 significant figures are maintained.  If you wish to have 14 significant figure in the data copied to the external program, right-click after you select the data and then right-click on the 
Copy (E-format) menu item.  This action will copy the data with just one format, but that format will provide 14 significant figures for data.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.527  10/23/13</strong><br/>
The Cascade command in the Windows menu has been modified to maintain the existing sizes of windows if possible when the are stacked. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.513  10/14/13</strong><br/>
It is not necessary to evaluate all of the outputs in a Call to an internal or external Procedure.  For example, consider a call to the PipeFlow Procedure in the Heat Transfer library.  Normally, the Call statement appears as shown on the next line where the arguments to the right of the colon are the outputs.<br/>
Call PipeFlow('Air', T, P, m_dot, D, L,RelRough: h_T, h_H, DELTAP, Nusselt_T,  f, Re)<br/>
<br/>
However, it you only want to return output h_H, the Call statement can appear as:<br/>
Call PipeFlow('Air', T, P, m_dot, D, L,RelRough: <span class="Blue">{h_T}</span>, h_H, <span class="Blue">{DELTAP}</span>, <span class="Blue">{Nusselt_T}</span>, <span class="Blue">{f}</span>, <span class="Blue">{Re}</span>) <br/>
<br/>
The quantities in braces are comments and need not be provided, but the list separators between outputs (commas in the US system, semicolons in the EU system) are required.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.508  10/07/13</strong><br/>
The Solution window can be navigated using the keyboard as well as the mouse.  A variable in the Solution window can be selected by pressing the Tab key until the variable is focused, as indicated by a reverse video display.  Multiple variables can be selected by holding the Shift key down while either clicking the left mouse button on the variable or pressing the Tab key to move the focus to the next variable.  Pressing the Enter key will bring up the Specify Format and Units dialog for the selected variable(s).  A typical EES problem may have multiple Solution windows, identified by the tabs at the top of the window.  The left and right arrow keys allow movement from one Solution window to the next.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.504  10/03/13</strong><br/>
In the Professional version, all tables are equipped with a control to automatically resize the column widths.  The control appears as a left-right arrow icon in the upper left cell of the table.  Clicking the icon causes all of the columns to be adjusted to a width that is just large enough to display all of the information the column.  Clicking the icon again returns the column widths to their original values.  If the Ctrl key is depressed when the icon is clicked, the column widths will be set to their default values. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.487  09/07/13</strong><br/>
The || operator can be used to concatenate strings more simply than with the Concat$ function since multiple strings can be concatenated, e.g., R$='R'||String$(10+12)||' is a common refrigerant.'  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.482  09/02/13</strong><br/>
In the Professional version, the Alter Values dialog (initiated from the Tables menu or by right-clicking on the triangular icon in table header cells) will accept EES variables that have been set to a fixed value in addition to numerical values for the First Value and Increment/Last Value fields.   </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.481  08/31/13</strong><br/>
The N Signif. Figs formatting option is provided in the Variable Information dialog, tables, plots and other places where numerical values are displayed.  This option allows the specification of a fixed number of significant figures. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.472  08/24/13</strong><br/>
The EES Web Server (EESws) program provides the ability for Distributable programs created with the Professional version of EES to be run with any browser program (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari) on any machine that supports these devices.  This capability allows any  EES program to be run on the internet, sigificantly enhancing  the concept of a Distributable program.  See the <a href="http://fchart.com/ees/eesws.php">EESws</a> documentation for more information. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.465  08/20/13</strong><br/>
  Two  new property functions have been added for incompressible fluids.  The Debye_T function returns the Debye temperature.  The IntK(T) function returns the integral of the specific heat between a reference temperature and T.  Both functions are useful for cryogenic applications. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.459 08/13/13</strong><br/>
The Debye library provided with EES provides functions for estimating the specific heat and specific internal energy using the Debye model.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.452  07/31/13</strong><br/>
Two additional options have been added to the $EXPORT directive.  The /D option will cause the exported values to have the display format that appears in the Solution window.   The /U option will export the units of the exported variables along with their values.</p> 

<p><strong>Version 9.450  07/29/13</strong><br/>
If the file name provided for a Help button for the Diagram window begins with http://, EES will start up the default browser program when the button is clicked and point it at the URL provided as the file name.  With this capability, Help in a Diagram window can reside on a website.</p> 

<p><strong>Version 9.443  07/17/13</strong><br/>
<a href="http://fchart.com/ees/ees_app.php">EES_App</a> creates a specialized web server on your computer to allow access to some of the features in your EES program.  Using this free application, you will be able to solve equations and obtain EES property data from any web-enabled device using a browser program (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari).  </p>  

<p><strong>Version 9.442  07/16/13</strong><br/>
EES online help is supplied with EES in file EES.chm.  Some networks prohibit use of .chm files.  For this reason, the Help menu now provides a
menu item named EES Index (web) in which the online help can be viewed from a browser pointed at the fchart.com website.  A link to the help
files is also provided on page http://fchart.com/ees</p>  

<p><strong>Version 9.440  07/15/13</strong><br/>
The $VarInfo directive allows variable information (e.g., the guess value, limits, units, display format, etc.) to be entered from the Equations window, rather than from the Variable Information dialog.</p>  

<p><strong>Version 9.437  07/13/13</strong><br/>
EES will now automatically recognize a unit setting made through the Convert or ConvertTemp function.  For example, X=5 Btu*Convert(Btu,kW-hr) will set the units of variable X to kW-hr. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.435  07/12/13</strong><br/>
The Minor Losses library provides resistance coefficients for steady-state flow.  This library has been implemented within the Heat transfer & Fluid Flow library.  It can be accessed using the Function Information dialog.</p>

An alternate set of units for displaying values in the Parametric, Arrays, Lookup, and Integral tables.  This is done by right-clicking in the column header and selecting Properties from the pop-up menu.  This action will display 
the Format Table Column dialog where an alternate set of units can be entered in the same dimensions as the primary set.  If the Show values in alternate units check box is selected, 
values for the variable in the column will be displayed in both the primary and alternate units. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.378  04/15/13</strong><br/>
An alternate set of units for display of values in the Solution Window can be entered in the Variable Information dialog. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.376  04/13/13</strong><br/>
Two new macro commands have been added to the Professional version. GetFirstFile$ will return the complete file name (including the path) of the first file found in the current directory having a file name extension of *.XXX and assign this name to a string variable. GetNextFile$ assigns a string variable to the name of next file having this file name extension.  If a file having the specified file name extension does not exist, the command will return a null string ('').  These commands can be used to open and solve multiple EES files, as shown in the example, or to open and process multiple data files that are read into a lookup table.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	SetDirectory('d:\testmacro')<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	F$=GetFirstFile$(*.ees)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	if (F$='') then quit<br>

<p><strong>Version 9.372  04/08/13</strong><br/>
The Mastering EES menu item will check to see if the Mastering EES version you own is up to date and offer the option of downloading a newer version if not.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.370  04/05/13</strong><br/>
A new file format for storing .EES files is in effect starting with this version.  EES files written by versions 9.370 and newer cannot be read by older versions.  However, the Save As
command provides an option to save an .EES file in backward compatible format.  This option allows users to exchange EES files, even though one may be older than version 9.370.  The
new file format provides the following new features: <br><br>

The number of independent variables that can be used in optimization problems has been increased to 20 for the Commercial version and to 80 for the Professional version. <br><br>

Right-clicking on a variable in the Solution window brings up a dialog that allows its format and units to be viewed or changed.  This dialog now provides the option of entering an
alternate set of units, which must have the same dimensions as the first set.  If the alternate set is provided, EES will do the necessary conversion and display the value in both sets of units
in the Solution window.  <br><br>

If you own the Mastering EES ebook, copy the file to the same directory as the EES program.  The Mastering EES menu option in the Help menu will open the .pdf file and it will automatically
supply the password. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.366  03/31/13</strong><br/>
EES will accept DELTAF, DELTAC, DELTAK and DELTAR as the units for temperature differences.  The DELTA will be automatically converted to a Greek character during output.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.364  03/28/13</strong><br/>
The maximum number of columns for a Lookup table has been increased to 1500.  The maximum number of rows is 9000 in the Commercial version and unlimited in the Professional version.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.357  03/17\7/13</strong><br/>
A Plot Thumbnails window is available in the Professional version.  This window displays all of the plots in the EES file at a size controlled by the user.  Right-clicking
on a thumbnail moves the focus to the selected plot in Plot window.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.351  03/06\7/13</strong><br/>
The Rename macro command (Professional version) has been implemented to allow any file to be renamed.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.350  03/06/13</strong><br/>
The $ImportText and $ExportText directives simplify the process of reading string information from a text file or the clipboard into string variables.  The corresponding
ImportText and ExportText macro commands (Professional version) allow file manipulation under the control of the macro commands.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.348  03/04/13</strong><br/>
The fluid names Siloxane_1, Siloxane_2, and Siloxane_3 have been changed to MM, D4, and MDM, respectively.  Thermodynamic property data for siloxanes MD4M and D5 have been implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.346-7  03/01/13</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport property data for cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene have been implemented.<br/>
The Find command can be invoked with the common Ctrl-F keystroke.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.342  02/27/13</strong><br/>
The thermodynamic property data for refrigerants R410A, R407C, R404A, and R507C are now determined by the generalized equation of state developed by E. Lemmon in
International Journal of Thermophysics, Vol. 24, No. 4, July 2003.  These relations provide more accurate results than the adapted Martin-Hou equationof State used
in previous versions and the assumption of incompressibility in the subcooled regime is not needed.  Note that the reference values for specific entrhalpy and 
entropy differ in the new formulations from their values in previous versions, so that the values may appear to be very different.  However, they are comparable if
a difference in the values between two states is examined.  Use the $Reference directive if you wish to change the reference state. The older property data can still be accessed by appending _MH to the name, e.g., R410_MH. 
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.338-9.340  02/26/13</strong><br/>

selected graphical item 90°C counterclockwise.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.324 02/08/13</strong><br/>
Thermodynamic and transport property data for R161 (fluoroethane) have been implemented.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.312 01/27/13</strong><br/>
$Warnings ON/OFF directives can be used in the Equations window to specifically control which equations can or can not issue warning messages.  The 
Warnings control in the status bar of the Equations window controls whether the Warning Information dialog window automatically appears after 
calculations are completed when there are warnings.  The Warning Information dialog window can be manually displayed by selecting Warnings from the
Windows menu.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.310 01/25/13</strong><br/>
The Computational Flow Window (Professional version) provides information on how EES solves the system of equations in the Main program and Subprograms.  It also provides a central point to locate all of the variables defined in the Equations Window, Parametric Tables, Diagram Window, Macros and elsewhere.  Included in this window are the blocking and calculation order used by EES, the variables determined in each block and their values, the relative and absolute residuals of each equation and the number of times each equation block is called.  The Computational Flow Window is most useful in the event that the system of equations does not converge to a solution.  It is also useful for determining the bottlenecks in the calculation procedure that result in increased computational time. The Computation Flow Window is a more powerful and useful presentation of the information in the Residuals window, which is provided in the Commercial version. If you wish to display the original Residuals window, hold the Ctrl key down while selecting Computational Flow from the Windows menu.

<p><strong>Version 9.300 01/10/13</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Version 9.284 12/9/12</strong><br/>
Property function IsentropicExponent returns the isentropic exponent of a fluid, defined as -v/P dP/dv|s. The insentropic exponent is identical to the ratio 
of Cp/Cv for an ideal gas, but it can differ significantly from this ratio for a real fluid. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.279 11/30/12</strong><br/>
The specific properties of brine solutions will be returned on a molar basis if EES is configured to operate in molar units.  However 
the solution concentration must always be provided in % on a mass basis.  The MolarMass_Soln function returns the molar bass of a brine
solution.  It requires the brine name and the solution composition.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.275 11/26/12</strong><br/>
Many new features are implemented in this version.  The Incompressible substance library (formerly called the Solid-Liquid library) has been
completely revised and built into EES, rather than implemented in library files as it used to be.  The data for existing substances has been improved and data for new substances have been added.  References are provided for all of these data.  The following Thermophysical property 
functions have been added for incompressible substances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ElectricalResistivity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthalpy_vaporization<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LinearExpCoef<br>

The NormalBoilingPt and Enthalpy_Vaporization functions are implemented for real fluids as well.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.264 11/06/12</strong><br/>
The IntEnergy, Enthalpy and Entropy functions can be used for brine fluids such as PG (polyethylene glycol-water solutions.)  The Enthalpy
function requires as inputs the temperature, composition, and pressure.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.260 11/04/12</strong><br/>
The capabilities of grouping items in the Diagram window have been signficantly improved.  Groups can consist of graphic items (lines, circles, etc.), text (of all types), buttons, check boxes and radio button groups. When grouped, all items are selected when one item in the group is selected and all items move together.  Right-clicking on a group provides access to its attributes, which allow it to be locked or hidden.  A group can be given a name that allows its hide attribute to be controlled programmatically. Grouping is provided in the Professional version.  </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.253 10/23/12</strong><br/>
The T-s property plots for high-accuracy equation of state fluids provide a choice of lines of constant specific volume or 
constant specific enthalpy. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.252 10/21/12</strong><br/>
The ONERROR GOTO XX command provides a way to modify the default behavior after an error occurs while executing commands in a Macro file.   After this command has been executed, an error will result in a jump to the macro command having label XX. ONERROR GOTO 0 returns the default behavior. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.247 10/13/12</strong><br/>
EES can read Lookup files having a .CSV format that contain string data, provided that the string information is enclosed within single quotes. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.242 10/09/12</strong><br/>
The FLUIDTYPE$ string function takes a single argument, which is the name of a fluid.  It returns a string that is one of the following:  'Ideal', 'Real', 'Brine', or 'SL fluid'.  This string function can be used to identify the type of fluid and thus the parameters is requires.  It is most useful for library routines. </p>

<p><strong>Version 9.240 10/06/12</strong><br/>
The IsIdealGas property function returns an integer that indicates the type of fluid:  It returns 0 for a real fluid, 1 for an ideal gas, -1 for a fluid in the Solid-Liquid fluids library, and -2 for a brine.<br><br>
The Internal and External Flow Convection libraries accept any type of fluid in the dimensional form.  If the name of brine, e.g., 'PG' is provided as the fluid, the concentration of the brine in a water solution is provided in % in place of the fluid pressure.  For example, the following function call will determine the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop for a 50% mixture of propylene glycol in water at bulk temperature T and flowrate m_dot  flowing in a pipe of diameter D and length L.<br><br>
call PipeFlow('PG',T,50[%],m_dot,D,L,RelRough:h_T, h_H ,DELTAP, Nusselt_T, f, Re)
</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.225 09/16/12</strong><br/>
A new optimization algorithm, called the DIRECT algorithm, has been implemented in the Professional version.  The Professional version of EES now provides a choice of 5 optimization methods for problems having two or more degrees of freedom.  Of the algorithms, only the Genetic and the DIRECT algorithms are designed to locate a global optimum when local optima exist in the search region.  Experience with the DIRECT algorithm shows that it is capable of finding a global optimum with many fewer function evaluations than the Genetic method.  However, it is not as efficient as the Direct Search, Variable Metric, or Nelder-Mead methods when local optima do not exist.
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.221 09/08/12</strong><br/>
The IF statement in a macro file can use one or more AND and OR logical operators.  The AND/OR operators must be surrounded by spaces.  
The order in which the logical tests are processed can be controlled by using parentheses.  The entire IF statement must be placed on 
one lines.  As an example, the following IF statement is valid in a macro. <br>
IF ((x>=y) OR (y=2)) AND (Z=3) then SOLVE<br>
<br>
The /L option in the $EXPORT directive and EXPORT macro command stops the carriage return - line feed from being written to a file
after the last variable is written.
A comma, semicolon, tab, or space will be written in its place, depending on the selected filename extension.  
Combined with the /A option, the /L option allows values from multiple $Export directives to be written on a single line.

X$ to '9.1'.  
</p>

<p><strong>Version 9.174 07/05/12</strong><br/>
The $Keyboard US/EU directive allows you to change the system keyboard setting while using EES.  For example, suppose you system is set to use the comma as the decimal separator.  Entering
$Keyboard US will change the setting in EES to use US setting, which assume a decimal point is the decimal separator and a comma is a list separator.  The example programs in
Mastering EES can then be entered exactly as they appear in the book, without having to change your system settings.

</p>
<p><strong>Version 8.732  12/19/10</strong><br/>
Functions and Procedures can employ logic statements such as If-Then-Else and Repeat-Until.  In some cases, use of these logic statements results in a repeated sequence
of on/off decisions and convergence thereby becomes impossible.  The $MaxCalls directive will eliminate such problems by placing an upper limit on the number of times 
the equations within the Function or Procedure are evaluated.  
If the number of calls to the Function or Procedure exceeds the specified limit, the Function / Procedure will return the same results as it did for the last valid call.  This capability effectively prevents the logic statements from providing alternating values. 
</p>
<p><strong>Version 8.725  12/13/10</strong><br/>
Right clicking (or double-clicking) on a text item in a plot window will bring up the plot text dialog window in which the font size and other characteristics of the

The format is <br>
InsertLookupRows 'Table Name' After NRows<br>
InsertParametricRows 'Table Name' After NRows<br>
where 'Table Name' is a string constant or variable indicating the name of the Lookup or Parametric table, After refers to the row below which the rows are added 
and NRows is the 
number of rows.  Both After and NRows can be numerical constants or pre-defined EES variables.  Set After to 0 to place the new rows at the top.
</p>
<p><b>Version 8.271  11/20/08</b><br>
In the Professional version, the $OpenLookup directive and OpenLookup macro commands can use a Format file to control the manner in which data are read from a file
into a Lookup table.  New specifications are provided in the Format file:  In addition to Skip, FixLFCR and AllowStrings are accepted.  
Skip n (where n is an integer) instructs  EES to skip the specified number of rows when reading the file.  This feature is useful to read around a header 
that may be included in the file.
FixLFCR is needed only when the text file to be opened was written on something other than the Window operating system.  
Text files written in Windows terminate each line with carriage return (Ascii 13) and line feed (Ascii 1) characters.  Unix systems use a different convention.  
Placing this specification in the format file will cause EES to read the file and rewrite it according to the Windows format.
AllowStrings will result in EES automatically setting a column in the Lookup table to be string format if it encounters a non-numerical character in the 
first row of data.  Otherwise an error will be issued if character data are encountered when the file is opened.
</p>
<p><b>Version 8.257  11/06/08</b><br>
Tired of the "beep"?  Well now, 5 separate sounds can be selected for different conditions from the Sound tab of the Preferences dialog.  The different sound choices

including the sounds to the default settings, delete the EES.PRF file and restart EES.
</p>
<p><b>Version 8.249  10/27/08</b><br>
The parameters for automatic step size integration can be specified in the Preference dialog or with the $IntegralAutoStep directive.  For example: <br>
$IntegralAutoStep Vary=1 Min=50 Max=2000 Reduce=1e-3 Increase=1e-5 <br>
sets the automatic step size algorithm to use variable steps that are adjusted at each step.  The minumum and maximum number of steps are 50 and 2000, respectively.  The
step size is reduced if the relative error increase above 1e-3 and it is reduced if the relative error falls below 1e-5.

</p>
<p><b>Version 7.037  02/14/04</b><br>
The Variable Information dialog window can represent all elements in an array with its array name by unchecking the
Show Array Elements checkbox at the upper right.  In this mode, the guess values, and lower and upper bounds for an array 
can now be set to other arrays.  For example, entering y[] as the guess value for array x[] will set the guess values of x[1], x[2], ... 
to y[1], y[2], etc, assuming that the array elements exit.  If array elements are later added to array x[], they too 
will be set to have their corresponding guess values set to y[] if the elements in the y array have been defined.
</p><p>
An Apply button has been added to the Variable Information dialog window.  Clicking the Apply button applies all of the changes that have

</p>
<p><b>Version 7.028  01/31/04</b><br>
The Make Distributable command provides a check list of external files that should be included with the Distributable program and a ..\UserLib
subdirectory is automatically created if needed.  Also check boxes are now available to control access to the
Calculate menu, and the Solution, Residuals, Arrays, and Integral Table menu items for each of the 10 EES files included in the Distributable
program.
</p>
<p><b>Version 7.025  01/28/04</b><br>
Link buttons placed on the Diagram window allow a number of capabilities including the ability to start other applications or EES programs, 
initiate macros, open child windows or load Lookup tables.  The top and left position of the link button can now be specified with 
EES variables.  A link button can be hidden during application mode by specifying its location to be off-screen.
</p>
<p><b>Version 7.020  01/18/04</b><br>
Graphical and text items in the Diagram window now have a Hide attribute.  The Hide attribute can be set with an EES variable.  For example, Ball.Hide=true# will 
hide the graphical object named Ball when the Diagram window is in Application mode.  The hide capability is useful for animation.
</p>
<p><b>Version 7.019  01/15/04</b><br>
If Warnings are enabled and if there are fewer than 80 simultaneous equations in the block being solved, EES will attempt to calculate the condition number 
of the Jacobian matrix used to determine the solution to the equations.  The condition number is the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue in this matrix.  
A large value of the condition number indicates that the equations may be singular and if so, a warning will be issued if the warnings are enabled with the 
$Warnings ON directive or the Warnings checkbox in the Preferences menu. The default value for the maximum condition number is 1E7.  
If EES displays a singularity warning, you should carefully check the equations in the block identified in the warning message.  
This is most easily done by examining the Residuals window.  If there is no problem, you should increase the size of the condition number test value 
in the Stop Criteria menu (Options menu) so that the warning does not occur.  
Note that calculating the condition number necessarily slows the solution process.  If speed is an issue, turn warnings off. 
</p>
<p><b>Version 7.014  01/09/04</b><br>
A Copy Table with Headers menu item has been added to the Edit menu and to the popup menu that appears when the right mouse button is clicked within a window containing

<p>The Make Distributable capability in the Professional version will save constants in the executable file.  A separate constants.txt file is no longer required.
</p>
<p><b>Version 7.000  01/01/04</b><br>
Version 7 provides animation capabilities to the Professional version.  Graphical objects and text placed on the Diagram or 
child Diagram windows can have attributes such as size, position, rotation angle, and color, that are determined by the values of EES
variables.  These attributes can change during a calculation using the Parametric or Integral table.  The changes will be displayed 
on the Diagram windows in an flicker-free manner.  The animation capabilities are controlled by an animation control bar in the
Diagram window that provides Start, Stop, Step, Loop and speed controls.  
In addition, plots can be animated with a red circle that shows the current value of a plotted quantity
allowing a direct coupling of graphics in the Diagram window to calculated quanitities. See the on-line help for details on how to invoke the
animation capabilities. 
Animations can only be created by the Professional version, but once created, they can be displayed in any version of EES, including
distributable programs.  The animation capabilities can be seen in the animation examples, accessible from the Examples menu item in the 
Help menu.  A number of new functions have been added to support the animation capabilities including:</p>
<p>
RGB(red,green,blue)	returns a color number based on its red, green, and blue components, each between 0 and 255.  The fill and line color of objects 
drawn on the Diagram window can be assigned to this color.</p>
<p>
DIAGRAMHEIGHT#(name) and DIAGRAMWIDTH#(name) return the height and width of the Diagram window with the specified name.  The main Diagram window is named 'main'. </p>
<p>  
LOOP# returns the number of loops (or restarts) that have occurred in an animation.  Looping can be useful for solving some types of dynamic steady-state problem,
independent of animation. </p>
<p>
PIXELSPERINCH# returns the number of pixels per inch in the Diagram and other EES windows.</p>
<p>
Graphical objects that are pasted into EES from other programs, such as PowerPoint, can be made transparent.  Their positions on the Diagram window
can be locked so that accidental movement does not occur while in the Development mode.
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.961  12/03/03</b><br>
The Reset Guesses menu item in the Calculate menu reset the lower and upper bounds of a variable as well as the guess value to the defaults.  
Now only the guess values are reset. 
The limits can be reset to their default values using the Reset Limits commands.  
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.958  11/23/03</b><br>
The axis scale of an existing plot line can be changed from the left to the and existing or new right axis scale by selecting the Modify Plot

</p>
<p><b>Version 6.943  11/07/03</b><br>
The optimization (Min/Max) routine will no longer consider as a potential optimum a solution for which the residuals are not all within tolerance.  If one or more
of the equations have not converged within the specified tolerances during any trial point, an error condition will be raised.  If the Stop on Error check box is
not checked, the optimization algorithm will proceed, but the objective function obtained for the constrained point will be ignored.
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.940  11/03/03</b><br>
The number of calculated variables that can be considered in an Uncertainty Analysis calculation has been raised from one to 12.  The X-Y plot allows

</p>
<p><b>Version 6.933  10/25/03</b><br>
Right-clicking on the tab in Parametric or Lookup table windows brings up a dialog window that allows properties for the selected table to be entered.  This dialog
now provides a Save button that allows the data in the table to be saved to an external text file with or without column headings.  This capability provides a
convenient way to export data from a table to another application.
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.925  10/13/03</b><br>
Equations that are placed between the $DOLAST and $ENDDOLAST directives are compiled and executed after all of the other calculations are completed.   
The capability to control the order in which equations are executed is seldom needed since EES automatically orders the equations to provide 
the most efficient calculation.  However, EES attempts to compile all equations before the calculations begin.  Some equations, such as those 
involving a Duplicate statement cannot be compiled unless the limits are known apriori.  In some cases, information such as the limits can be calculated 
and then used in further calculations.  The $DOLAST directive is useful in these situations.  
Another applications of the $DOLAST directive would be to set the limits of an Integral function or to allow Uncertainty Propagation calculations with 
independent variables that have not been set to constants.
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.924  10/12/03</b><br>
The units of constants appearing in the Equations window are specified by placing the units within brackets after the value.  This capability now is applicable to 
algebraic expressions involving constants within parentheses.  For example, entering:  X=(1/16)[in]*Convert(in, m) in the Equations window will not generate a 
unit check warning provided that the units of X are set to [m].  
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.907  09/28/03</b><br>
An EES Instant Update menu item has been added to the Help menu to facilitate obtaining a new version of EES from the F-Chart Software server. 
Note that you must have an internet connection and a current subscription to Instant Update service to download a new version.  This command
will exit EES as this is necessary to install the new version. 
</p>
<p><b>Version 6.905  09/26/03</b><br>
If an output step size is not provided with the integration variable in the $IntegralTable directive, EES will now display the specified

<p><b>Version 6.685  01/03/03</b><br>
The $IF and $IFNOT directives allow selective exclusion of equations.  A common use is to eliminate the need to comment out equations that define 
variables that are also defined in a Parametric table.  When more than one Parametric table exists, the $IF and $IFNOT commands allow each
table to use a different set of equations.  The Solve Table command can be issued to solve all tables without having to change any

Multiple plots can be selected in the Modify Plot command by holding the Shift key down while clicking (or dragging) the mouse in the plot line list.   If a change is made to a parameter, that change will be applied to all selected plots when the Apply or OK button is clicked.  This capability makes it easy to, for example, change the size of the symbols for all plots at one time. 

<p><b>Version 6.165  02/24/01</b><br>
The output stepsize in the $IntegralTable directive will accept a variable name in addition to a numerical constant.

<p><b>Version 6.163  02/22/01</b><br>

<p><b>Version 6.105  12/02/00</b><br>
The Copy Plot command has the capability of placing two copies of the plot on the clipboard.  One copy is a Picture (enhanced metafile) and the other is a high precision bitmap.  The high precision bitmap provides a high quality plot image, but it consumes a great deal of memory - particularly so if the image is in color.  Starting with Version 6.105, the option of placing a bitmap copy on the clipboard is, by default, disabled.  Instead, the picture is copied as an enhanced metafile with a default resolution of 600 pixels per inch so it will print at high quality from the application it is pasted into.   The resolution of the clipboard copy, and options for copying in color and as a bitmap can be changed in the Plots Tab of the Preferences dialog. 

<p><b>Version 6.088  11/07/00</b><br>
Buttons have been provided on the Diagram Window Text Input Dialog to facilitate entry of subscripts, superscripts and symbols.

eliminate the warning that appears when EES is started while other EES applications are running.

<p><b>Version 6.075  10/21/00</b><br>
High accuracy property data for n-pentane have been implemented.  n-Butane and R600 now both use the high accuracy property data for n-butane.

<p><b>Version 6.074  10/20/00</b><br>
A WARNING procedure has been implemented (similar to the ERROR procedure) to allow the user to display warning messages.  Previously, only the last warning message could be displayed.  However, now warning messages are placed in a message que and all of the messages are displayed when calculations are completed.  The warning messages are not generated or displayed unless the 'Show Warning Messages' checkbox in the Options tab of the Preferences dialog is checked.

<p><b>Version 6.066  10/10/00</b><br>
The Solution window provides separated tabbed windows to display values of local variables in functions, procedures, and modules.  This capability is controlled by the 'Show function/procedure/module values' control in the Options tab of the Preferences dialog.

It is now possible to send any macro command directly to EES from another application such as EXCEL.  See the online help section for Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)

<p><b>Version 6.044 9/4/00</b><br>
The StringLen returns the number of characters in the string constant or string variable supplied as an argument.  For example, StringLen(A$) returns the length of the string stored in variable A$.

The NLookupRows function returns the number of rows in the Lookup table or Lookup file specified in the string argument.  For example NLookupRows('Lookup 1') returns the number of rows in the Lookup file named 'Lookup 1'.

A help context  file can be provided with library help files.  The help context file has the same name as the library file but with a .CTX filename extension.  EES will look for the .CTX file when help is requested.  If a .CTX file is found, EES will open the file to find the context number for the topic that has the name of the function for which help is requested.  The Help file will be then opened directly to that topic.  See help on Library Files for details.

<p><b>Version 6.042 8/31/00</b><br>
The $SaveLookup directive will accept a ? or ?? for the filename that the data are to be saved to.  In this case, a standard save file dialog will appear from which the filename can be chosen.  For example:
$SaveLookup TN$ ?
will save the Lookuptable having a name that is stored in string variable TN$ to a file selected from the save file dialog and the selected file will replace the ? so that the save dialog does not reappear.  If ?? is used, the replacement will not occur.

<p><b>Version 6.041 8/30/00</b><br>
The $OpenLookup directive can have an optional second parameter which must be a string variable name.  The name of the Lookup file that is opened is assigned to this variable.  For example:
$OpenLookup ?? myLookupFile$
will bring up a standard file input dialog from which the file name can be selected.  That Lookup file will be opened and copied into the Lookup Table Window and myLookupFile$ will be set to the name of the file.

<p><b>Version 6.040  8/28/00</b><br>
Plots now over the option of a 2nd X axis (X2) scale.  The axis scale is initially placed at the top of the plot but it can be moved with the Ctrl up/down arrow keys.  The 2nd Y axis (Y2) scale can be moved with the Ctrl left/right arrow keys.  The Modify Plot dialog now provides additional controls to allow the axis scale to be changed after a plot is constructed.

Property data for R507A are now built into EES.  The transport properties for R404A, R407C, R410A, and R507A have been update using recent correlations presented by Geller et al.  See the online help for the respective fluids for details.

<p><b>Version 6.029  08/07/00</b><br>
The width and height of buttons in the Diagram window can be adjusted in Development mode by selecting the button and holding the Ctrl key depressed while pressing any of the arrow keys.  For example, Ctrl-right arrow increases the width of the selected button by 1 pixed.  Ctrl-Left arrow decreases the width.  If the Ctrl key is not pressed, the button position, rather than its size, will be changed.

<p><b>Version 6.022  07/27/00</b><br>
A menu item has been added in the Help menu to access the EES manual in Acrobat format.  The menu item will be disabled if file EES_Manual.PDF is not in the directory that EES is started from or if Acrobat is not installed.

A $Import directive has been implemented to directly read variable values from a text file.  The $Import directive has the following format:  

$Import 'FileName.csv' A, B, C, X[1..5], G$

Note that both string and numerical values can be read from the disk file.   See the online help for details.

A  ? or ?? can be supplied as the filename in the $OpenLookup directive (Professional version).  When the $OpenLookup directive is processed,, a Windows open file dialog will appear from which the filename can be chosen.  If a single ? is supplied, it will be replaced with the selected filename.  The double ? will not be replaced so that the open file dialog will appear everytime the $OpenLookup directive is processed.

<p><b>Version 6.020  07/20/00</b><br>
An expiration date can now be optionally specified for Distributable programs generated with the Make Distributable command (Professional version).

<p><b>Version 5.047 9/9/99</b><br>
The Units.Txt file has been modified to accept µm as a length unit.  To enter µm, hold the Alt-Key down and type 230 on the  numeric keypad.  Let the Alt key up and the µ should appear.  Then enter m.  Other useful characters are Alt-248 which displays the degree symbol ° and Alt-250 which appears as a dot (·) and is used to represent multiplication.  The Convert routine in EES will accept a hypen (-), a  star (*) or character 250 (·) as a separator for units.  For example, W-hr, W*hr and W·hr will all be accepted in the Convert command for Watt-hours.

<p><b>Version 5.044 9/5/99</b><br>

<p><b>Version 5.020  7/31/99</b><br>
Temperature - enthalpy plots can be generated using the Property Plot option in the Plot menu for substances using the high accuracy Fundamental Equation of State.  The on-line help for Fluid Property Information identifies the substances that use this equation of state.

<p><b>Version 5.016  7/27/99</b><br>
A temperature conversion function has been implemented.  The ConvertTemp function has the following format:  ConvertTemp('C', 'F', T).  The first two parameters are string constants or string variables which must be C, K, F, or R, respresenting the Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit, or Rankine scales.  The third parameter is a temperature in the scale indicated by the first parameter.  The function returns the temperature in the scale indicated by the second parameter.  In the example above the function would return the temperature in F corresponding to the temperature T in C.  The single quotes around the string constants are not required.
    	
<p><b>Version 5.015  7/26/99</b><br>
An IntegralValue function has been implemented to allow retrieval of data from the Integral Table. (See version 5.004)

<p><b>Version 5.014  7/22/99 </b><br>
The arrowhead size can now be changed on the Plot and Diagram windows.  The arrowhead  size is automatically scaled when the Plot or Diagram size is changed.

<p><b>Version 5.012  7/19/99</b><br>
Ø	A Data button has been added to the Modify Plot dialog.  This button becomes active if the Automatic Update option is enabled.  When clicked, the Data button allows the source of the plotted data to be changed.  It is possible to change the range of rows, the X and/or Y- axis columns and the table from which data are plotted.  EES will automatically update the  plot to reflect the change in the data source.  The most common use for this capability is to  change the range of rows that has been previously selected for a plot line.
Ø	
 High accuracy properties for Helium have been incorporated.

<p><b>Version 5.005  7/12/99</b><br> 
Link buttons can now be placed on the Diagram window in the Professional version.  Clicking a link button can be used to start an external application or run a specified EES program.  This capability simplifies chaining EES programs for sequential operation.  High accuracy property data for nitrogen have added replacing the previous less- accurate correlations.  The new property data are valid from 65 to 2000 K at pressures up to 1000 MPa. 

<p><b>Version 5.004  7/03/99</b><br> 
A new directive called $IntegralTable allows intermediate values of specified variables  during numerical integration with equation-based Integral functions to be automatically  placed in an Integral Table.  The values in the Integral Table can be plotted, printed, or copied.  See the on-line help for details.

<p><b>Version 4.993  6/12/99</b><br> 
High accuracy thermodynamic and transport properties for propane and isobutane have been added.

The Professional version provides a means of creating a distributable program that can   include up to five EES programs.  Normally, the first EES program is the one that shows up   when the distributable program is launched.  However, placing a /# (where # is an integer   between 1 and 5) as a parameter will select that file at startup.  For example, entering   MyDist.exe /2 into the Windows Run dialog window will start the distributable program called  MyDist.exe and bring up the second file.

Text and objects on the Diagram windows can now be selected using a selection rectangle, as  in most drawing programs.  
	
<p><b>Version 4.989  6/9/99</b><br>

<p><b>Version 4.985  5/28/99</b><br> 
A function called NTABLEROWS has been added.  This function takes one string argument  and that argument may be 'Parametric', 'Lookup', or 'Arrays' or the name of a Lookup file stored  on disk.  In this case, the name may be provided as a string constant or a string variable.   The  function returns the number of rows in the specified table.	

<p><b>Version 4.980  5/20/99</b><br> 
Two new directives have been added to the Professional version.   $OPENLOOKUP  LookupfileName  will open the a Lookup Table and read the data in the file designated as   LookupFileName.   SAVELOOKUP LookupfileName will save the Lookup Table in a file with   the specified name.

A SAVE button can now be placed on the Diagram window of Distributable programs  (Professional version).  When clicked, the SAVE button saves the current values of all variables  and the current  values for all input variables in the Diagram window in a .VAR file having the  same name as the parent EES file.  This file is automatically loaded with the distributable  program is opened which restores the inputs in the Diagram window to the values they had  when the SAVE button was clicked.

<p><b>Version 4.970  5/1/99 - 612/99</b><br> 
High accuracy property data are now available for a number of fluids including carbon dixiode,  methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, R32 ammonia, oxygen  and R134a.

The Professional version now allows up to 10,000 variables and equations.	
	
<p><b>Version 4.917 02/15/99</b><br> 
The Residuals window now uses bold font to show which variables are determined by the  equation(s) in each block.  This capability makes it easier to see the order in which EES is  determining the values of the unknown variables.
 
<p><b>Version 4.911 02/08/99 and 4/07/99 </b><br>
The units of a variable which is on the left side of an equation (by itself) in the Equations window  can  now be automatically set using a comment in which the units are enclosed in braces.  Additional text following the unit specification can be provided.  For example: 
      h=400 "[Btu]"    
      P4=P3/100 "[bar]   this equation will set the units of variable P4 to bar"  

<p><b>Version 4.908 02/03/99 </b><br>
A Check Units command has been added to the Calculate menu.  This command will check the  dimensional and unit conversion consistency of all equations except those in functions and  procedures.  It is necessary to enter the units of each variable for the checking process to  function properly.  The units can be entered in the Variable Info dialog window or in the Solution  window.  The checking algorithm cannot know the units of conversion constants, so it is best to  avoid them in your equations.  The Convert function should be used instead.  For example,  suppose you have two variables, L_inch and L_feet, whose units are set to inches and feet,  respectively.  This following equation will not check properly because the units of 12 are not  known.
         L_inch=L_feet*12  
However, if the convert function is employed as shown next, the equation will be accepted. 
        L_inch=L_feet*convert(ft,in)

<p><b>Version 4.906 01/31/99</b><br> 
A set of string functions has been implemented to facilitate manipulations of string variables.  The string variables are: CONCAT$, COPY$, LOWERCASE$, STRING$, STRINGPOS, STRINGVAL, and UPPERCASE$.  Detailed information is available in the on-line help.

<p><b>Version 4.896  01/11/99</b><br> 
The size of the symbol used in plots can now be modified in the Modify Plot dialog.  The symbol  size scales proportionally as the plot rectangle is resized.   In plots with many points, placing a  symbol at each point results in a messy plot, although some symbols may be needed for  plot line identification.  The Modify Plot dialog now also provides a control to specify symbols  to be drawn every N points, where 1<N<# of points.  The Modify Plot dialog is accessed with the plot menu or by right-clicking on the plot window.
 
<p><b>Version 4.890   01/04/99</b><br> 
A plot window access button has been added to the Diagram window toolbar.  When clicked, the plot window access button displays a small dialog in which the desired plot window and button caption can be entered.  A button with this caption then appears on the Diagram window and it can be dragged to the desired location if the tool bar is visible.  Clicking this button when the tool bar is hidden will display the Plot window.
	
<p><b>Version 4.884  12/15/98</b><br> 
The operation of the Diagram window has been changed.  First, a tool bar has been added to this window and to the child Diagram windows (Professional version) to create graphic objects (text, lines/arrows, rectangles, and ellipses) and to manipulate these objects.  Second, the Diagram window now has two modes: development and application mode.  The development mode is active when the tool bar is visible.  Objects in the Diagram window can be moved, modified, or deleted in development mode.  The entire window can be resized.   However, the input variable edit boxes and drop-down lists are disabled in development mode.  When the tool bar is hidden, the Diagram window is in  application mode.  In application mode, the graphic objects cannot be moved or modified. The Diagram window will	 accept user input and, after calculations are completed, the values of output variables will be displayed.  Ctrl-D is a keyboard shortcut for the Diagram window.  If the Diagram window is not in front, Ctrl-D brings it to the front.  If the Diagram window is foremost, Ctrl-D toggles the visibility of the tool bar.  Shift-Ctrl-D toggles the visibility of the tool bar in the Diagram window and all child diagram windows.

<p><b>Version 4.882  12/10/98 </b><br>
A tool bar has been added to the plot windows to facilitate adding text, lines/arrows, boxes and ellipses.  A Show/Hide tool bar command in the Plot menu replaces the Add Text and Add Line commands.  Multiple items on the plot window can now be copied, moved, and alligned.
	
<p><b>Version 4.876  11/30/98</b><br> 
Plots printed by EES on a laser printer look great.  However, when the plot is copied and pasted to another application, such as a word processor, the quality of the printed plot is not as good.  The reason for this degradation in quality is that the plot is copied at the resolution of the screen.  However, in this version, the Copy Plot command now also puts a high resolution bitmap on the clipboard.  You can select a picture (as before) or a bitmap using the Paste Special command in the external program. The bitmap requires much more memory, but it produces a high quality image when printed.

<p><b>Version 4.874 11/27/98</b><br> 
Selected text items in the Diagram window can now be cut, copied, and/or pasted to a child diagram window or to a Diagram window in a different EES program (Professional version only).  To select one or more text items in the Diagram window, hold the Shift key down while clicking on the text item. To select a drop-down string list, click just the left of the rectangle.  Selected text items are displayed within a red dotted rectangle.  To unselect text items, click anywhere on the Diagram window, but not  on a text item.	

<p><b>Version 4.873  11/25/98</b><br> 
The Plot Windows 'fly-out' menu that appears when the Plot Windows menu item is selected from the Windows menu now displays each plot window as the mouse is moved over the different plot window menu items.  This behavior should make it easier to find the plot window that you wish to move to the front.  You can disable this behavior by holding the Ctrl key down while selecting the plot window menu item.

<p><b>Version 4.871  11/23/98</b><br> 
Variable Information files with filename extension *.VAR can now be opened with the $INCLUDE directive.

<p><b>Version 4.867  11/16/98</b><br> 
Two small buttons have been added to the Variable Info dialog (Professional Version only) to allow  variable information to be read from or saved to a file.  The variable information file has a .VAR filename  extension, but it is a text file that can be opened in a word processor or spreadsheet.  Variable   information data can be saved to an existing .VAR file.  In this case, the file is updated with the current  information for the variables that are in use.  Information in the file concerning variables that are not   currently in use is not modified or deleted.  If a program contains one or more modules, a dropdown  list appears at the top center of the Variable Info dialog from which the module or main program can be  selected.  Variable information are read or saved for the selected module or main program.  The read   and save variable information buttons make it very easy to prepare and use a file containing your   common variables with appropriate guess values, limits, and units.  

<p><b>Version 4.863  11/11/98</b><br> 
The Lookup table will now accept string data, as well as numerical data.  The format style must be set  to String.  This change is made by clicking in the column header and selecting String as the style.  The  LOOKUP$ function is used to return string data.  It operates exactly like the LOOKUP function.	

<p><b>Version 4.859  11/05/98</b><br>  
A Directories Tab has been added to the Preferences dialog in the Options menu.  Default directories for opening and saving files can now be specified.  In addition, a directory in addition to the USERLIB directory can now be used to preload library files when EES is started.  See the on-line help for details.
	
<p><b>Version 4.853  10/27/98</b><br> 
An EES variable with name JTHETA will be displayed as a J in Symbol font, which appears as a  'curly theta'.  

<p><b>Version 4.852  10/26/98</b><br> 
The maximum number of rows in the Parametric and Lookup tables has been increased to 9000 from the former limit of 6500.  There is no limit to the number of rows in the Professional version.
<p><b>
> Version 4.851  10/25/98</b><br> 
A green 'go' triangle is displayed in the upper left cell of the Parametric table.  Clicking the left mouse button in this triangular area will initiate the Parametric Table calculations for the rows indicated  below the triangle.  The row range is that selected during the last use of the Solve Table dialog.  To select a different range, click the left mouse button in the first row.  Hold the Shift key down and then click the mouse in the last row.  Continue to hold the Shift key down while clicking in the green triangle.

 A shorthand notation for array variables has been implemented to facilitate passing of array variables to internal and external Functions and Procedures.  A range of array variables can be indicated by separating the first array index value from the last index value by two decimal points. For example, X[1..5] can be used in place of X[1], X[2], X[3], X[4], X[5].   This shorthand notation is supported for two dimensional array variables as well.  Since all EES statements must be 255  or fewer characters, this notation can be used to pass long argument lists.  The notation can be used in the arguments of function calls and CALL statements, in Function and Procedure  statements and in $Common directives.  See Array Range Notation in the online help for details.

 The AVERAGE function has been added as a built-in function.  The SUM function has been modified to accept a list of argument, in addition to the former index-based format.

 There is no longer any inherent limit on the number of variables that can be passed to an external procedure with .FDL format.  (The former limit was 50 inputs and 50 outputs).  Up to 1000 variables can be passed in the argument list of external functions using array range notation.	

<p><b>Version 4.850 10/22/98</b><br> 
EES now will display unmatched left or right parentheses in bold during input in the Equations Window.
	
<p><b>Version 4.847 10/17/98 </b><br>

<p><b>Version 4.812 8/22/98 </b><br>
EES now provides bar plots and contour plots in addition to the X-Y plots provided in previous versions.  The New Plot Window command displays a submenu with the three plot types.   Look at the online-help for X-Y plot, bar plot and contour plot for details.

EES recognizes three externally compiled files of types .DLF, .DLP, and .FDL.  Previously, only one routine could reside in an externally compiled file.  It is now possible to include one or more external routines in a .DLL file.  All three file types can be included in the same file.   The mechanism for telling EES the names and types of the external routines is to provide  three short routines in the DLL file with names DLFNames, DLPNames, and FDLNames that do nothing but return the calling names of each routine type in the DLL file.  DLFName, DLPNames,  and FDLNames must be exported in the DLL.  They have one argument which is a character  string.  The character string is filled with the names of the routines of each type that are contained  in the DLL file.  A comma separates each file name.  A zero length string is used to indicate that  there are no files of that type.  An example, written in DELPHI 4 is provided in the on-line help.

	
<p><b>Version 4.810 8/20/98</b><br> 
Right-clicking on the Calculate button in the Diagram window will allow the Calculate button caption to be changed.

A French version of EES has been developed.  Contact F-Chart Software if this is of interest to you.	

<p><b>Version 4.802  8/10/98</b><br> 
The New Plot and Overlay Plot commands have been modified to allow multiple variables to be selected in the Y-axis list.  A separate plot line will be generated for each selected variable.  All selected variables will be plotted with the same axis scale.  If more than one Y-axis variable is selected, the symbol and color list boxes will display 'auto'.   With the 'auto' option, the  symbol and color for each plot line will be automatically selected by EES so that each plot line has a different symbol and color.  This feature can be overridden by simply selecting the symbol and color.

<p><b>Version 4.791   7/25/98</b><br> 
Subscripts and superscripts are now displayed in comments in the Formatted Equations  window.

<p><b>Version 4.790  7/20/98</b><br> 
The capabilities of the Debug window have been expanded.  If EES detects that a solution is constained, the DEBUG window will display all variables and equations that are are constrained.  Clicking on a variable will open the Variable Info dialog where the lower or  upper bound on the variable value can be changed.
 
<p><b>Version 4.784  7/6/98</b><br>
The Variable Info dialog now provides a Show Array Elements checkbox control when one or more arrays are present in the Equations window.  When this control is selected, all array  elements appear in the Variable Info dialog and the guess value, bounds, display format, and units can be set for each individual element as before.   However, when the control is not  selected, all arrays elements are represented by a single entry.  For example, X[ ] represents all array elements with parent name X.  If any of the characteristics for the array are changed,  that change is applied to ALL array elements.  For example, changing the guess value for X[ ]  will result in the new guess value being applied to all array elements in array X.  However, other  characteristics, such as the bounds and units, would not be affected. In addition, the array name  can be changed by editing the name in the first column of the Variable Info dialog.  (Note that the  names of array elements, e.g., X[5], can not be edited.)  If an array name is changed, that  change is applied to all array elements.  The change occurs in the Equations window, the  tables, and the Diagram window. 

<p><b>Version 4.782  7/1/98</b><br>
A Calculate button can now be placed on the Diagram window to more conveniently initiate calculations involving input and output variables in the Diagram window.  The button is enabled with a check box control in the Add Diagram Text dialog which appears whenever Diagram window text is added or modified.   

<p><b>Version 4.781  6/26/98</b><br>

<p><b>Version 4.776  6/15/98</b><br>
Store and Retrieve Parametric Table commands have been added to the Tables menu.  The Store Parametric Table command will save all information relating to the existing Parametric table in a binary file having a .PAR filename extension.  The Retrieve Parametric table will read a specified .PAR file and restore the Parametric table to the same condition it was in when the Store Parametric Table command was issued.  Although EES only allows one Parametric table at a time, the Store and Retrieve Parametric Table commands provide almost the same effect as having multiple Parametric Table windows.

<p><b>Version 4.775  6/10/98</b><br>
This version heralds the introduction of the Professional version of EES.  The Professional  version provides the following capabilities:  
1.  A series of EES instructions (called a macro) can be recorded with the Build Macro command in the File menu.  EES can later be started from the Windows Run command or  from a different program to replay all of the instructions in the Macro file.  Used in this manner, EES can be directed to solve a set of equations in a specified text or EES file and put the solution into another specified text file without ever appearing on the screen.  The online help for the Build Macro command provides details.

2.  The capabilities of the Diagram Window have been expanded.  It is now possible to define 'hot areas' in the Diagram Window which, when clicked, bring up a child Diagram window having all of the same capabilities as the main Diagram Window.  A link to 'hot areas' and 'child Diagram windows' can be found in the online help for the Diagram window.

3.  The Make Distributable Program was available in previous versions.  However, this capability is now available only in the Professional version.

	Contact F-Chart Software if you wish to update your existing version of EES to a Professional version.


<p><b>Version 4.770  6/08/98 </b><br>
Entering the values of array variables can be painful in EES.  For example, if you want to define array X with 10 values ranging from 1 to 10, you would have to enter X[1]=1; X[2]=2; etc.  The new  Insert/Modify Array command in the Edit menu has been implemented to help enter values for  one and two-dimensional arrays.  After selecting this command, you can enter (or paste) the  values directly into a spreadsheet-like table.  When you click the OK command, EES will  generate the necessary EES equations to define the array at the bottom of your Equations  window.  EES will surround the array equations with a special set of comments.  If you later  modify the array, EES will look for these comments to determine if the array has already been  set.  Set the on-line help for details.

A number of conveniences have been added to the Plot Windows. It is now possible to select  more than one text item or line.  Once selected, changes can be applied to all selected items at one time.  For example, the font size of all selected text items can be changed at once.

Each press of an arrow keys moves all selected text items or lines one pixel in the arrow  direction.

When more than one text item or line is selected, alignment buttons are provided to align the  selected items relative to each other. The alignment option becomes available after clicking the  right mouse button or double-clicking the left mouse button.

The Delete key will delete all selected text items or lines.  The Paste command will restore the deleted items.

Holding the Ctrl key while resizing a plot prevents the text size from changing proportionally with  the plot size.  Also in this version, the text within a plot will be moved to appropriate locations in the plot if the scale on the X or Y axis is changed.


<p><b>Version 4.715  3/01/98</b><br>
   Two new built-in functions have been added.  
	Erfc(X) is the complement to the Error function equal to 1 - erf(X).  
	CIS(theta) is a short way of entering COS(Theta)+i*SIN(Theta).  	

<p><b>Version 4.710 2/21/98</b><br>
The psychrometric chart produced by the Property Plot command now allows the user to enter  the lower and upper temperature limits for the abcissa.
	
<p><b>Version 4.700  1/23/98 - 2/2/98 32-bit only) </b><br>
The keyword Subprogram has been changed to Module.  Modules no longer require a colon to distinguish inputs from outputs.  Commas are used to separate the arguments.  The entire Module concept has been revised.  When a Module is called, the equations in the Module are transparently grafted into the equations in the main EES program.  The result can be  seen in the Residuals window which lists all of the equations that are solved more in less in the order that EES solves them.  Additional information is provided in the online help. 

<p><b>  (Version 4.660  1/12/98 32-bit only) </b><br>
EES now can solve equations with complex variables.  Many changes have been made to support this capability.  For details, look at Complex Numbers in the online-help.

<p><b>  (Version 4.649  12/25/97 32-bit only)</b><br> 
The number of allowable plot windows has been increased from 5 to 10.   The plot windows are accessed with the Plot Windows submenu in the Windows menu.  The plot windows can also be accessed with keyboard shortcuts.  For example, Ctrl-1 will bring Plot Window 1 to the front.   The keyboard shortcuts for all menu commands are shown in the menus.

 NOTE:  EES versions 4.648 and earlier can only read 5 plot windows.  If you save a file having  more than 5 plot windows, a General Protection error will result when you attempt to open this file with an older version of EES.  EES should, however, then function normally although some of the plots will be lost.  

<p><b> (Version 4.643  12/05/97 32-bit only) </b><br>
By popular demand, a control has been added to the Print dialog to allow printing of multiple  copies (32-bit version only).

<p><b> (Version 4.634  11/09/97) </b><br>
It is now possible to display gridlines on plots at positions between the axis numbers.  To change the appearance of an axis display, double-click the left mouse button (or click the right mouse button) on the axis.  The Modifiy Axis dialog will appear.  Select the Grid lines control, if it is not already checked.  The # Ticks/Division should appear within a rectangle. Clicking  the left mouse button within this rectangle will cause the display to change to # Grids/Division.  In this case, grid lines instead of tick marks will be displayed. 

<p><b> (Version 4.625  10/20/97 32-bit only) </b><br>
Great news for Europeans!  EES is now able to represent numerical values using a comma rather than a decimal point as the decimal separator.  To invoke this capability, you must set the Decimal Symbol in the Number tab of  the Windows Control Panel Regional  Setting dialog window to a comma.  Then start EES.  EES will automatically convert the format of all values in previously saved files.  The comma is now the decimal separator.  The list  separator character, which in the U.S. version is a character, is now a semicolon.  The  semicolon in the U.S. version was used to allow multiple equations to be place on one line.  Use  the period character for this purpose.

<p><b> (Version 4.616  9/30/97) </b><br>  
Uncertainty analysis has been implemented.  The Uncertainty analysis commands are  in the Calculate menu.  The Uncertainty Propagation Table places uncertainty values in the  Parametric table.  Subsequent plotting allows error bars to be drawn representing the   propagated error.  See the on-line help for details.

<p><b> (Version 4.616  9/30/97) </b><br>
The column widths in the Parametric, Lookup, and Arrays tables may now be individually  changed.  To change the column width, move the cursor to the header row and position  it over a column divider line.  The cursor icon will change to a column size icon.  Drag the  column divider line to its new position.

<p><b> (Version 4.614  9/21/97 32-bit only)</b><br> 
Functions T_crit, P_crit, and v_crit have been added to return the critical temperature, pressure,  and specific volume respectively.  These functions take one parameter which is the name of the fluid.  A string variable can be provided.

<p><b>  (Version 4.611  9/18/97) </b><br>
A menu speedbar has been implemented with one-button access to the most commonly applied menu commands.  If you wish, you can disable the menu speedbar with the  Preferences command in the Options menu by setting the 'Display menu speedbar' control.

<p><b> (Version 4.610  9/17/97)</b><br>
 The Default Variable Information command in the Options menu allows the guess values,  bounds, display format and units for variables to be automatically set based on the the  first letter of the variable.   It is now possible to have multiple sets of Default Variable  Information by using the Load and Store buttons that have been added to the dialog.  Store will store the currently defined defaults in a file having a .dvi filename extension.  Load will load a previously-stored file and apply the defaults to all existing and new variables.  The EES_DFLT.dvi file contains the variable defaults EES will apply when it is started.

<p><b> Version 4.600 9/01/97 32-bit only </b><br>
Property data for R404A, R407C, and R410A  have been added.  These fluids are quite different  from any of the others in the data base in that they are blends.  R404A and R410A exhibit very little  temperature glide, so its T-s and P-h plots looks like those for a pure fluid.  However, the T-s and  P-h plots for R407C show the capabilities of the new property functions.  

<p><b> Version 4.600 9/01/97 32-bit only</b><br>
   Modules are now supported.  Modules are used exactly in the same manner as procedures.  The 'Procedure' keyword is replaced with 'Module'.  The Module is accessed with a 'Call' statement.  The difference between a Module and Procedure is that the Module can use equality statements, rather than assignment statements as used in Procedures.  Each Module has its own set of variables.  Each Module can have up to 5000 variables.  The guess values for the Modules and main program are accessed with the Variable Info command.  See the on-line help for documentation.

<p><b> Version 4.459  8/09/97 </b><br>
EES will automatically load the HELLO.EES file if it finds this file in the EES main directory.   You can place messages, directions, or any information you wish in this file.   This file is  named HELLO.EES.  If you do not with this file to appear when you start EES, rename it or delete it.   Alternatively, hold the Shift key down to bypass opening the Hello.EES file.

<p><b> Version 4.458  8/07/97</b><br>
Text items and lines/arrows on the plot windows can now be cut and copied to the Clipboard using the commands in the Edit menu.  This feature makes it easy to copy text and lines from one EES plot window to another.
 
<p><b> Version 4.457  8/04/97</b><br>
Two new directives have been added: 
$Warnings On/Off controls the setting of the Warnings Option in the Preferences dialog 
$Arrays On/Off controls whether arrays variables are displayed in a separate Arrays table.  
Other directives are $Common, $Include, and $Complex On/Off.

<p><b> Version 4.456  8/02/97</b><br>
The height and width of the Variable Info dialog can be changed.

<p><b> Version 4.454  7/30/97</b><br>
The Lookup, Interpolate, and Differentiate functions will now accept an ASCII Lookup file, in addition to the binary .LKT file that wasaccepted in previous versions.  More information can be found in the online help under topic Lookup File Formats.

<p><b> Version 4.440  07/01/97</b><br>
A bullet line type is now provided in the Add Line (Plot Menu) and Add Diagram Line (Options Menu) commands.

A external procedure called JANAF is provided with EES.   JANAF provides the specific heat, specific enthalpy, and specific entropy (3rd law reference) as a function of temperature for many substances.  The format is:
     CALL JANAF(Substance,T: CP,H,S)

More information is available from the Function Info dialog (Options menu).  Click the External Procedure button;  Then select JANAF and click the Info button.
 
<p><b> Version 4.430  6/05/97 </b><br>
Lines and/or arrows to the Diagram window using the Add Diagram Line  that has been added to the Options Menu.  This command works in exactly the same manner as the Add Line in the Plot menu, except that it draws lines or arrows on the Diagram Window.

<p><b> Version 4.423  5/23/97</b><br>
 Make Distributable Program now provides controls which can restrict user access to theTables and Plot menus.

<p><b> Version 4.421 05/21/97</b><br>
An Apply button has been provided for the Add Diagram Text command Option menu) and the Add Text command (Plot menu) so that multiple  text items can be added to the Diagram window or Plot windows, respectively,  with one execution of the command.

<p><b> Version 4.420  05/20/97</b><br>
EES now provides support for string variables.  A string variable is identified with a $ as the last character in its name, as in Basic.  String variable can be assigned to string constants which are characters enclosed within single quotes.  A string variable can be used wherever character information is normally provided to EES.  For example, the following EES equations are now accepted.

 	h=enthalpy(R$,T=100,P=200)
	g=interpolate(F$,Col1$, Col2$, Col1$=h)

 where R$ is a string variable that will be assigned to legal fluid name during execution of the EES program.  F$ is the name of a Lookup file stored on disk.  Col1$ and Col2$ are string variables for the names of the columns in the Lookup table.  String variables can be defined in the Equations Window, in the Parametric Table, or in the Diagram Window.

<p><b> Version 4.384  3/3/97</b><br> 
A new form for the INTEGRAL function has been implemented which allows differential and integral functions to be solved without use of the 
Parametric table.  The format for the  equation-based INTEGRAL function is:  y = y0 + INTEGRAL(fxy, x, lowx, highx, stepx).   
y0 is the initial value of y.  fxy is an EES variable or expression representing the integrand.   
The integration variable is x and it is integrated between values lowx and highx.  Stepx is optional.  
If stepx is not provided, EES will use an automatic-step size adjustment algorithm.  The value of the integral is determined numerically.  
Additional examples, DRAG.EES, SUBSTEPS.EES, and DBL_INTG.EES  have been added to illustrate the use of the INTEGRAL function.  
See the on-line help for a more detailed explanation of the expanded capabilities of the INTEGRAL function.

<p><b> Version 4.383 02/28/97</b><br> 
The capabilities of the $INCLUDE directive have been expanded to allow library files, as  well as text files to be automatically loaded.  EES now provides a Browse option  if the file indicated in the $INCLUDE directive can not be found. 

<p><b> Version 4.380  02/23/97</b><br> 
The Debug window has been changed to provide more useful information.   
The Debug window is accessible when you try to solve a set of equations which has a different number of  equations than unknowns.   
The Debug window shows a listing of all variables which are  used only once in the Equations window.   
A  mistyped  variable will often be in this category.  
In addition, EES will now try to identify which variables are likely to be involved in an overdefined or underdefined problems.  
The Residuals window can now be accessed even if the solution was not successful.  
The Residuals window provides information on the blocking and order of solution of the equations which may be useful in debugging your problems.

<p><b> Versions developed before 1/1/97</b><br> 
<p>Help files provided for external functions and procedures can now be either ASCII help files or  Windows.HLP files.  In either case, the filename extension should be .HLP.  EES will determine  whether the file is a Windows HLP file.

<p>The Solutions window has been changed to simplify the process of entering units or changing display format.  Clicking the left mouse button on a variable name now selects that variable name which is shown in inverse video.  To unselect it, click it again.  Multiple variable names can be selected. Pressing the Enter key, double-clicking the left mouse button on a variable name or clicking the right mouse button will bring up a dialog window in which format specifications can be entered.  These format specifications will be applied to ALL selected variables.  

<p>New formatting options have been provided.  Appending _dot to a variable name will cause that variable to be displayed in the Formatted Equations, Solution, and Parametric Table with a dot centered over the name.  For example, T_dot will display as T with a dot centered above the T.  Similarily, T_bar will display a bar centered over the T.  T_infinity will display a subscripted infinity symbol.  DELTAT will display the a Greek Delta followed by T.

<p>Clipboard operations have been improved.  When the Solution Window is foremost, the Copy command will place a picture of the selected variables in Solution window on the clipboard, as well  as the text version of the solution.   You can copy either the text or the picture to another application  using  that application's Paste Special command.  Similarly, the selected  equations and comments appearing in the Formatted Equations window can be copied as a picture to the Clipboard.  The  Select All will appear as Select Display when the Formatted Equations window or the Solution  Window is foremost.  This command will select all visible items in the window. 

<p> An Apply button has been added to the Modify Plot dialog window.  Clicking the Apply button shows any changes that have been made without exiting the Modify Plot dialog.  The characteristics of  multiple plot lines can be made at once in this manner.  The OK button accepts all changes that have been made.  Cancel restores the plot window to the condition it was in before the Modify Plot dialog was started.
 
<p>The MIN and MAX functions formally required two arguments.  They have been modified to  accept 1 or more arguments and return the minimum  or maximum value, respectively.
 
<p> Default options for the plots, such as the plot size and axis scale attributes can now be specified in the Plot Options section of the Preferences dialog.
 
<p> Double-clicking the left mouse button (or clicking the right mouse button) on an equation in the Residuals window will cause the Equations window to be moved to the front with the selected equation highlighted.

<p>	A new formatting option has been added.  This formatting option, called Automatic, selects the style and number of digits depending on the magnitude of the number.  This option should make it unnecessary for the user to select Fixed Decimal or Exponential format, except when a particular format is needed.  The Automatic formatting option is now the default for any new variables.   Variables defined in problems written in older versions of EES will have the  formatting options  selected as previously specified.  The formatting option can be changed by clicking on the variable  in the Solutions window or by use of the Variable Info command in the Options menu.  If you hold the  Ctrl key down while changing a formatting option, all variables below the one being changed will also be changed.  The Automatic formatting option can also be used for the numbers on the axes of plots.   
<p>	
<p> New functions INTERPOLATE and DIFFERENTIATE have been added to provide interpolation or numerical differentiation of tabular data.  The data normally reside in the Lookup Table, but these functions can also access data in Lookup files or the Parametric table.  The format of the  INTERPOLATE command is

<p>g = INTERPOLATE('C:myFile',' Col1', 'Col2', Col2=2.34)

<p>The first parameter shown in the above example is optional.  If present, it must be the DOS name of  an existing Lookup file previously saved with the Save Lookup Table command.  Col1 and Col2 are  the names of the columns from which data are to be interpolate.   The single quotes around the  column name are optional.  The final parameter indicates whether a value in the first or second  column is specified.  As shown above, an interpolate value from Col1 will be found corresponding to  a value of 2.34 for Col2.

<p>The DIFFERENTIATE command returns d(Col1)/ d(Col2).  It has the same format as the INTERPOLATE command.  See the online help for additional information.


<p> Clicking on the column header in the Parametric, Lookup, or Arrays table brings up a dialog window which allows the characteristics of that column to be changed.  A new control has been added to this dialog window to select the back color for data in the column.  The back color can be used to simply highlight the data, or for other purposes, such as to indicate which columns require data input.

<p> A unit conversions function has been added to EES.   The CONVERT function takes two string  parameters and returns the factor to convert from the units represented by the first string to that represented by the second string.  As an example, the following equation would convert a heat transfer coefficient from English to SI units.

<p>      h_SI = h_Eng * Convert('Btu/hr-ft^2-R', 'W/m^2-K')

<p>Note that the single quotes and the ^ symbol are optional.  Additional unit definitions can be added to the UNITS.TXT file in the EESW directory.  See the online help for additional information.

<p>The columns in Parametric table can now be reordered using the Insert/Delete Vars command  in the Tables menu.  The order of the columns in the Parametric table is controlled by the order of the variables in the Table Variables list.  The order of the variables in the Table Variables list can now be changed using the drag and drop feature.  To change the column position of a variable, click on its name and then hold the mouse button down while sliding it to a new position.

<p> It is now possible to control the foreground and background colors of the text displayed in the  Solutions window.  To change the color, click on a variable in the Solution window.   A dialog window will appear in which the colors can be changed.

<p> EES can read an ASCII text file (with a .TXT extension) into a Lookup table.  In this case, the first line of the file must contain the number of rows and columns in the table.   If a negative number is provided for the number of rows, EES will determine the number of rows of data in the file and use that number for creating the table.  If the number of columns is a negative number, EES will use the absolute value of this number for the number of columns and expect to find the format specification (e.g. F3 or E4)  followed by one space and then the column heading and units for each column on following lines .  The units are  enclosed in square brackets.  Following lines contain the data for each row, separated by one or more spaces.  The example below would create a table with 2 rows  and 3 columns when read in with the Open Lookup command in the Tables menu.  The  columns  would be formatted with E4, F0, and F3 format specifications and the column names will be ColA,  ColB, and ColC.  
<p> -1     -3 
<br>E4 ColA [Btu] 
<br>F0 ColB  
<br>F3 ColC 
<br>1.23E-12  2	4.56 2.34E-11	  4	7.89

<p>The MolarMass property function has been implemented.  This function takes one argument, the name of the fluid, and returns the molar mass (commonly called the molecular weight).  Here is an example:  m11=MolarMass(R11)

<p>EES now offers the option of bar plots.  A bar plot is produced if the plot symbol is chosen to be the open or filled bars presented at the bottom of the plot symbol list.

<p>Suppose you wish to change every occurrence of variable X1 to X_1 to take advantage of  EES's ability to display subscripts.  You could do a global change and replace, but then you would also have to reenter the guess values, limits, and units for the new variable X_1.  And  if  X1 appears in the Parametric table, you would have to remove it and add X_1.  However, there is now an easier way.  You can simply edit the variable name in the Variable Info dialog window and EES will make all of these changes for you.

<p>The Solution Window will now display subscripts and superscripts for units.  For example, m^2 will appear with a superscript 2 if the 'Display Subscripts and Greek Symbols' option is selected in the General Display section of the Preferences dialog.  An underscore character indicates subscript as in lb_m.

<p> A Print Preview button has been added to the Print dialog window.

<p> An Add Legend Item check box has been added to the New Plot and Overlay Plot dialog windows.  If this control is checked, a text item will be automatically generated with the name of the Y-axis  variable.  The text item will be associated with the line type and symbol selected for the plot line.  The feature makes the generation of a plot legend more convenient. The text item is placed at the upper left of the plot.  It can then be dragged to any location.

<p> Clicking the right mouse button in the Equations window will either insert or remove curly brace  comments around the selected text.  If the selected text is already commented, i.e., begins with  a left brace and ends with a right brace, the comments will be removed - otherwise the braces will be inserted.

<p>  Previous versions of EES have allowed the user to add fluid property data with the Martin-Hou  equation of state as explained in Appendix D.  It is now possible to add additional JANAF table data as well, by placing a file with the appropriate coefficients in the USERLIB sub-directory.  The file must have a .IDG filename extension.  The file TESTIDG.IDG in the USERLIB sub-directory provides data for CO2 with comments to explain the file format.  

<p>  The ERROR procedure now accepts an optional error message string.   See the online help   for the syntax and an example. 

<p>  A snap-to-grid option has been provided for moving text on the plot and diagram windows.  The snap to grid option is set in the Preferences window.  Holding the Ctrl key down while moving text disables the snap to grid option. 

<p>  Internal EES functions and procedures can now make use of the $COMMON  directive to pass information from the main program.  The $COMMON statement must follow the FUNCTION or PROCEDURE declaration.  The $COMMON directive should be the first item to appear on the line.  Variables appearing in the $COMMON statement are separated  with commas, as in this  example.

<p>FUNCTION  TESTCOMMON(X)
<br>$COMMON B,C,D {variables B,C, and D are from the main program}    
<br>TESTCOMMON:=X+B+C+D
<br>END
<br>
<br>B=4;  C=5;  D=6
<br>G=TESTCOMMON(3)
